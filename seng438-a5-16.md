# Introduction
This lab was just opening the dataset provided in the example files and then observed the data.
# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
We had issues on importing the data in one of the example files in the sample input folder. Now, we've learned how to import the data on the STRAT application by just copying the data from the Failure Report document and paste the choosen column in the text file. Then run it in STRAT

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Overall. This lab is harder than the previous ones
